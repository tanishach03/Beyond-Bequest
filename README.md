## üìÑ ABSTRACT
There's a time in every person's life when they think that their time has come and they should look after their assets and plan the distribution of their will. In times like these, Beyond Bequest comes to their rescue.<br>
We aim to make this possible by creating a decentralized application which will ensure fair distribution and stamp out the increasing number of conflicts which arise as a result of discrepancies and confusions in the current process.

## üóíÔ∏è INTRODUCTION
This project effectively solves the problems which govern the process of will distribution.Nowadays, we see many advocates deceiving their clients by manipulating the data about the assets or their distribution. We aim to make this possible by creating a decentralized application which will
ensure fair distribution and stamp out the increasing number of conflicts which
arise as a result of discrepancies and confusions in the current process.

The flowchart above depicts how our solution will work. First the person will be asked to register if not registered yet.The registration process asks for basic details such as name, aadhaar number, phone number, email id etc.If the farmer is already registered on the portal, then he/she can enter the credentials to login and then to continue towards distributing his/her assets and this is how the data will be sent, directly to the database without any modifications. On the other hand, once the government receives the data in its database the quality of the produce can be verified manually and, if approved, the necessary actions can be taken and a certificate in the form of an NFT will be generated at the receiver‚Äôs end.
In this way, there will be direct exchange of data between the person and his/her successor. Hence there would be transparency, the costs forced by the middlemen (advocates) would be completely eliminated, and the method is secure and trustworthy since there is no involvement of any third-party services.

### üîë KEY FEATURES OF THE APP
- Data is stored on the blockchain network hence, there would be no possibility to manipulate the data
- Once the crop details are entered then no one can modify them
- Safe and secure on the Blockchain Network
- Since there can be no manipulation of data, the entire system is trustworthy and there is transparency
- The cost to the farmer which served as a commissions to the middlemen, would be completely eliminated

### üåà CONCLUSION
The proposed solution is going to remove all sorts of injustice which sometimes, the advocates do to the people.

### FUTURE PROSPECTS
- Instead of manually initiating the process, we can use an API to fetch the death certificate data which will initiate the will distribution automatically.
- The government can make use of this application to make the process of will distribution secure, transparent and reliable.
- Unique certificates in form of NFT can be generated which will ensure fairer distribution.
